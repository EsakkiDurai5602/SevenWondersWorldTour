            The Great Pyramid of Giza, built for the Pharaoh Khufu around 2570 BCE, is the
            oldest and only surviving member of the original Seven Wonders of the Ancient
            World. Its astonishing precision, monumental scale, and enduring mystery continue
            to inspire engineers, historians, and travelers alike.
